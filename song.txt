Speed it up, slow it down
Need control, need it now
I need to live a thousand times
I cannot stop, I cannot cry
I will not fret, I will not die
I am machine, I stay alive
Sometimes I think, sometimes I think
Sometimes I think, sometimes I (oh)
I've got no aim, a million rounds, is nothing real
A hundred pounds of heavy steel, it feels so loud
Tied to my chest, it feels so loud
I'll take a peek to across the peaks
This grass is neat and I'm quite unique
But I'd like to be, but I'd like to be
And I hope this is the hardest part
We try, we try
And when they say they're satisfied
They're lying, they're lying
Do forgive me, I've seen the treasure's in the bloom
But right now, I'm just not strong enough for you
Sorry, you can see it in my retina
Focus in and out, I'm doing better
Artificial ghost with no perception
I wanna be a Chevy, not a Sentra, uh (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I don't feel the way they programmed me to feel today
Some pieces falling from the waist up
I'm so sorry for delays
Just need one moment to erase
That burning pain before the rage
I feel good, I feel good, I feel good (I fixed it)
And I hope this is the hardest part
We try, we try
And when they say they're satisfied
They're lying, they're lying
Do forgive me, I've seen the treasure's in the bloom
But right now, I'm just not strong enough for you
And I hope this is the hardest part
We try, we try
And when they say they're satisfied
They're lying, they're lying
Do forgive me, I've seen the treasure's in the bloom
But right now, I'm just not strong enough for you
